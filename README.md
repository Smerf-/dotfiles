Kyle Merfeld's dotfiles.

This is a collection of my dotfiles. Running the "install" file will
symlink my dotfiles to the locations they belong.

This will also install some packages if ran on arch.


To use a different profile, such as dev, run the following

`stow dev --override=.*`

This will override all files with those in the dev folder
